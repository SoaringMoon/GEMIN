# GEMIN Flare
Repo for the GEMIN Flare Token

GEMIN Flare is a cryptocurrency token on the Flare Network blockchain, part of an analog, alternate reality metaverse roleplaying game. Similar to that of a tabletop roleplaying game, GEMIN is used to simulate a realistic economy based in the World of Una the Infinite Archipelago. Any person can take part in this roleplay universe, and a large amount of GEMIN was distributed to a random selection of people to ensure that a majority of the currency was not held in a single place. If you do not wish to take part in this experimental cryptocurrency, simply ignore the tokens you have received, burn, or return them.
